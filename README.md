# 🔥 Torch-Box

> A structured deep dive into **PyTorch fundamentals and internals** — built as a continuous learning notebook.

This repository documents my hands-on exploration of PyTorch, starting from low-level tensor operations to building neural networks from scratch and using PyTorch’s high-level APIs.

The goal is **conceptual clarity**, **implementation depth**, and **long-term reference** — not quick tutorials.

---

## 📌 Why this repository?

- Understand PyTorch beyond `.fit()` and abstractions  
- Learn **how things work internally**
- Build intuition by implementing core components manually
- Maintain a clean **learning streak repository**
- Create reusable notes for future ML & DL system design work

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- **Theory → Code → Observation**
- Prefer **from-scratch implementations first**
- Use `torch.nn` only after understanding internals
- Keep notes short, precise, and reproducible
- Focus on *why*, not just *how*
